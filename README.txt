--------------------------Color Detection---------------------------------

In this project, to implement color detect for sequentially change image. You need to read bellow given instructions:

1. Open Command Prompt and write python ColorDetection.py then press Enter.

2. In open window there will be one image and two buttons. 
   - 'Show Graph Button' is use for display graph of each RGB Color Code.
   - 'Exit Button' is use for exit from current window

3. Then click anywhere in the display image to see the image with color name and RGB Color code for where you click.

4. To close that open image you need to press the 'Esc Key'.

5. When you press 'Esc Key' then automatically the next image will appear on the label.

6. This process will continue untill you press on 'Exit Button'.

----------------Instructions For Used Library------------------

In this project I had used six library like as numpy,pandas,tkinter,openCV,matplotlib,pillow

numpy - For collection of image, I had used pillow library.
pandas - To fetch all data from csv file.
tkinter - To create a GUI application such as label, button, etc.
openCV - To open the image from label.
matplotlib - For draw graph of each RGB color code.
pillow - To display sequentially change image on label

------------------------Other Instructions------------------------

-> The window label is use for displaying sequentially change image.
-> The csv file stores the Color name with its RGB Color Code and hex code separated with comma(,).
