----------------Instructions For Usable Library------------------

In this project I use six library like as numpy,pandas,tkinter,openCV,matplotlib,pillow

numpy - For collection of image with use of pillow library.
pandas - For fetch all data from csv file.
tkinter - For create a GUI application such as label, button, etc.
openCV - For open the image from label.
matplotlib - For draw graph of each RGB color code.
pillow - For display sequentially change image on label

------------------------Other Instructions------------------------

-> In Window Label is use for display sequentially change image.
-> In csv file store the Color name with its RGB Color Code seperate with comma(,).
